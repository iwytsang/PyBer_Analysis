# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
As a data analyst for Pyber, a ridesharing app company, the CEO of the company has given a new assignment. The purpose of the assignment is to create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type and to create a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

From the summary data frame, we can see that the most rides and drivers are from the Urban city type, while the least is the rural city type. This correlates with the total fares, as the more rides there are, the amount of fares. However, the azverage fare per ride and per driver is the highest in rural city and lowest in urban cities.

## Summary

Three business recommendations
1. Based on the fact that the rural total fares and total rides are the lowest of all city types, there may not be enough incentive for people to ride taxis in rural cities. One business recommendation could be increasing the incentive for people to take the taxis, for example, getting a discount coupon on subsequent rides after their first ride.
